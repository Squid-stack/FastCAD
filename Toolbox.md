A "ToolBox" is known as a developer engine. 
Popular toolbox's known as GoDot, Unity, and UE4.

GoDot: GoDot is usally made for 2D games, or what've saw. Mostly GoDot is for good quality Full HD 2d games. While it works like all engines, with nodes, and stuff.
While you can learn unity within a hour, you can learn GoDot, within 5 minutes, working correctly, and GoDot takes under a minute for it to download.

Unity: C# easy to learn, big community, can copy scripts easily, can learn easily, good scripters, good tutorials. Mostly unity is exactly like GoDot, instead slower,
full HD for 3D, and 2D games. (Correct me if im wrong), there is a lot of games that are very famous and unity was used to make it. Roguelike games, fall guys, Among us,
and more.

Unreal Engine 4 (UE4): Unity, instead a little more complicated, and Blueprints. Blueprints are made for you, to work things and produce and tell the AI how they should
work. A lot of childhood games, have used Unreal Engine, such as Gears of War, Battlelands, and A LOT MORE, Unreal Engine 4 uses C++, and C++ is hard, but same with C#.
lol

That's all
